# **Pig Latin Converter**

## Three functions:
1. Pigify 
2. Generate pigctionary JSON from word list (to then use for unpigify function)
3. Unpigify [very slow tbh]

**TODO l8r**
 - Investigate exporting C++ projects as a single .exe [seems easy enough]
 - Maybe create simple GUI?

***Known Issues***
 - Spaces multiplying on unpigified output
 - Unpigified output is doing 0 unpigifying
 - No JSON reading yet

_I'm going to learn C++ one way or another_
