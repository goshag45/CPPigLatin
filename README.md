# **Pig Latin Converter**

 - ~~Implement Encoding~~
   - ~~Keep punctuation~~
   - ~~Keep spaces~~
   - ~~Keep capitalisation~~
 - ~~Implement Decoding~~
   - ~~all of above in reverse~~ 

DAMN decoding is going to be much harder than I thought.
 - Pig latin is non reversible, need to use dictionary (or ML LOL)
 - Parse Google 10k common word like into JSON
    - Pigify each word
    - Use as key in dict

**TODO l8r**
 - Investigate exporting C++ projects as a single .exe
 - Maybe create simple GUI?

I'm going to learn C++ one way or another
